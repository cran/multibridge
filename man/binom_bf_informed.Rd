\item{bf_type}{character. The Bayes factor type. When the informed hypothesis is compared to the encompassing hypothesis,
the Bayes factor type can be \code{LogBFer}, \code{BFer}, or \code{BFre}. When the informed hypothesis is compared to the null hypothesis,

\item{seed}{numeric. Sets the seed for reproducible pseudo-random number generation}

\item{maxiter}{numeric. Maximum number of iterations for the iterative updating scheme used in the bridge sampling routine.

\description{
Evaluates informed hypotheses on multiple binomial parameters.
These hypotheses can contain (a mixture of) inequality constraints, equality constraints, and free parameters.
Informed hypothesis \eqn{H_r} states that binomial proportions obey a particular constraint.
\eqn{H_r} can be tested against the encompassing hypothesis \eqn{H_e} or the null hypothesis \eqn{H_0}.
Encompassing hypothesis \eqn{H_e} states that binomial proportions are free to vary.
Null hypothesis \eqn{H_0} states that category proportions are exactly equal.
}
\details{
The model assumes that the data in \code{x} (i.e., \eqn{x_1, ..., x_K}) are the observations of \eqn{K} independent
binomial experiments, based on \eqn{n_1, ..., n_K} observations. Hence, the underlying likelihood is the product of the
\eqn{k = 1, ..., K} individual binomial functions:
\deqn{(x_1, ... x_K) ~ \prod Binomial(N_k, \theta_k)}
Furthermore, the model assigns a beta distribution as prior to each model parameter
(i.e., underlying binomial proportions). That is:
\deqn{\theta_k ~ Beta(\alpha_k, \beta_k)}
}
\note{
The following signs can be used to encode restricted hypotheses: \code{"<"} and \code{">"} for inequality constraints, \code{"="} for equality constraints,
\code{","} for free parameters, and \code{"&"} for independent hypotheses. The restricted hypothesis can either be a string or a character vector.
For instance, the hypothesis \code{c("theta1 < theta2, theta3")} means
\itemize{
\item \code{theta1} is smaller than both \code{theta2} and \code{theta3}
\item The parameters \code{theta2} and \code{theta3} both have \code{theta1} as lower bound, but are not influenced by each other.
}
The hypothesis \code{c("theta1 < theta2 = theta3 & theta4 > theta5")} means that
\itemize{
\item Two independent hypotheses are stipulated: \code{"theta1 < theta2 = theta3"} and \code{"theta4 > theta5"}
\item The restrictions on the parameters \code{theta1}, \code{theta2}, and \code{theta3} do
not influence the restrictions on the parameters \code{theta4} and \code{theta5}.
\item \code{theta1} is smaller than \code{theta2} and \code{theta3}
\item \code{theta2} and \code{theta3} are assumed to be equal
\item \code{theta4} is larger than \code{theta5}
