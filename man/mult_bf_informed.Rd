\arguments{
\item{x}{numeric. Vector with data}

\item{Hr}{string or character. Encodes the user specified informed hypothesis. Use either specified \code{factor_levels}
or indices to refer to parameters. See ``Note'' section for details on how to formulate informed hypotheses}

\item{a}{numeric. Vector with concentration parameters of Dirichlet distribution. Must be the same length as \code{x}. Default sets all concentration parameters to 1}

\item{factor_levels}{character. Vector with category names. Must be the same length as \code{x}}

\item{cred_level}{numeric. Credible interval for the posterior point estimates. Must be a single number between 0 and 1}

\item{niter}{numeric. Vector with number of samples to be drawn from truncated distribution}

\item{bf_type}{character. The Bayes factor type. When the informed hypothesis is compared to the encompassing hypothesis,
the Bayes factor type can be \code{LogBFer}, \code{BFer}, or \code{BFre}. When the informed hypothesis is compared to the null hypothesis,
the Bayes factor type can be \code{LogBFr0}, \code{BF0r}, or \code{BFr0}. Default is \code{LogBFer}}

\item{seed}{numeric. Sets the seed for reproducible pseudo-random number generation}

\item{maxiter}{numeric. Maximum number of iterations for the iterative updating scheme used in the bridge sampling routine.
Default is 1,000 to avoid infinite loops}

\item{nburnin}{numeric. A single value specifying the number of burn-in samples when drawing from the truncated distribution.
Minimum number of burn-in samples is 10. Default is 5\% of the number of samples. Burn-in samples are removed automatically after the sampling.}

\description{
Evaluates informed hypotheses on multinomial parameters. These hypotheses can contain
(a mixture of) inequality constraints, equality constraints, and free parameters.
Informed hypothesis \eqn{H_r} states that category proportions obey the particular constraint.
\eqn{H_r} can be tested against the encompassing hypothesis \eqn{H_e} or the null hypothesis \eqn{H_0}.
Encompassing hypothesis \eqn{H_e} states that category proportions are free to vary.
Null hypothesis \eqn{H_0} states that category proportions are exactly equal.
}
\details{
The model assumes that data follow a multinomial distribution and assigns a Dirichlet distribution as prior for the model parameters
(i.e., underlying category proportions). That is:
\deqn{x ~ Multinomial(N, \theta)}
\deqn{\theta ~ Dirichlet(\alpha)}
}
\note{
The following signs can be used to encode restricted hypotheses: \code{"<"} and \code{">"} for inequality constraints, \code{"="} for equality constraints,
\code{","} for free parameters, and \code{"&"} for independent hypotheses. The restricted hypothesis can either be a string or a character vector.
For instance, the hypothesis \code{c("theta1 < theta2, theta3")} means
\itemize{
\item \code{theta1} is smaller than both \code{theta2} and \code{theta3}
\item The parameters \code{theta2} and \code{theta3} both have \code{theta1} as lower bound, but are not influenced by each other.
}
The hypothesis \code{c("theta1 < theta2 = theta3 & theta4 > theta5")} means that
\itemize{
\item Two independent hypotheses are stipulated: \code{"theta1 < theta2 = theta3"} and \code{"theta4 > theta5"}
\item The restrictions on the parameters \code{theta1}, \code{theta2}, and \code{theta3} do
not influence the restrictions on the parameters \code{theta4} and \code{theta5}.
\item \code{theta1} is smaller than \code{theta2} and \code{theta3}
\item \code{theta2} and \code{theta3} are assumed to be equal
\item \code{theta4} is larger than \code{theta5}
