# multibridge 1.2.0

The null model now constrains all category proportions to be equal. In previous versions, the null model constrained only the category proportions to be equal that were included in the informed hypothesis, leaving the other category proportions free to vary.

The output of the S3 method summary now included the log marginal likelihoods of the encompassing model, the null model, and the informed model.
